## Project meant for a class-demo/exercise related to REST Error Handling.

The repo includes a VERY SIMPLE Java-based backend server without a database. It uses a simple static map as "database".

Most of the error handling on the backend is Ready, implemented using the ResponseStatusException. So the main focus for the class demo and exercise is on the client.


## Tasks on the Client

- Change all fetch code to use the async-await structure
- Add Error handling that report errors using the detailed descriptions from the server and the suggested utility function to do this
- Remove ALL alerts from the code
